### Understanding Your Subscription

Each subscription has:

- **Investment Amount**: What you paid
- **Tier**: Auto-calculated (1, 2, or 3)
- **Monthly Rate**: Return percentage
- **Daily Income**: Paid Monday-Friday
- **Earnings Cap**: 3x your investment
- **Days Active**: How long it's been earning
- **Total Earned**: Current earnings
- **Remaining Capacity**: How much more it can earn

### Example Investment

**Scenario**: You invest $1,000

- **Tier**: Tier 1 (6% monthly)
- **Daily Income**: $1,000 × 6% / 30 = $2.00/day
- **Earnings Cap**: $1,000 × 3 = $3,000
- **Time to Cap**: ~1,500 days (if no other bonuses)

**Monthly Breakdown**:
- Daily earnings: ~$2.00 (Mon-Fri only)
- Monthly earnings: ~$40-44 (20-22 working days)
- Plus referral commissions if you build a team!

### 3x Earnings Cap

> ⚠️ **Important**: All subscriptions have a 3x earnings cap

**What This Means**:
- Maximum lifetime earnings = 3× your investment
- Applies to: Daily bond income only (for subscriptions)
- Commissions count toward user's global 3x cap
- Once reached, subscription stops earning

**Example**:
- Invest $500 → Max earnings $1,500
- After earning $1,500, this subscription becomes inactive
- You keep all earnings, but subscription stops producing income

### Getting Your Referral Link

1. Go to Dashboard
2. Find "Your Referral Link" section
3. Copy your link or referral code
4. Share with others

**Your Link Format**:
```
https://phonix.com/register?ref=YOUR_CODE
```

### Commission Structure

**20-Level Commission Rates**:

| Level | Rate | Direct Referrals Required |
|-------|------|---------------------------|
| 1 | 10% | 0 (Direct referrals) |
| 2 | 5% | 0 |
| 3 | 3% | 2 |
| 4 | 2% | 2 |
| 5 | 2% | 3 |
| 6-10 | 1% | 3-5 |
| 11-15 | 0.5% | 6-8 |
| 16-20 | 0.3% | 9-10 |

**Direct Referrals**: People who join directly using your link

### How Commissions Are Calculated

**Example Scenario**:

You (Level 0)
├── Alice (Level 1) - Your direct referral
│   └── Bob (Level 2) - Alice's direct referral
│       └── Charlie (Level 3) - Bob's direct referral

**Charlie invests $1,000**:
- **You earn**: $1,000 × 3% = $30 (Level 3, need 2 directs)
- **Bob earns**: $1,000 × 5% = $50 (Level 2)
- **Alice earns**: $1,000 × 10% = $100 (Level 1)

### Direct Referral Requirements

To earn from deeper levels, you need direct referrals:

- **Levels 1-2**: No requirement (everyone earns)
- **Level 3+**: Need 2 direct referrals
- **Level 5+**: Need 3 direct referrals
- **Level 20**: Need 10 direct referrals

> 💡 **Strategy**: Focus on getting quality direct referrals who will build their own teams!

## Rank System

### Rank Overview

Ranks are based on **leg volumes** - total investments in your referral legs.

### Rank Tiers

| Rank | Requirements | Weekly Bonus | Duration |
|------|--------------|--------------|----------|
| **Connector** | Main: $5K, Other: $5K | $50/week | 52 weeks |
| **Builder** | Main: $10K, Other: $10K | $200/week | 52 weeks |
| **Professional** | Main: $20K, Other: $20K | $500/week | 52 weeks |

| **Crown** | Main: $200K, Other: $200K | $5,000/week | 52 weeks |

### Understanding Leg Volumes

**What are Legs?**
- Each direct referral creates a "leg"
- A leg includes all investments down that line

**Example**:

You
├── Leg 1 (Alice's team): $8,000 total volume
├── Leg 2 (Bob's team): $15,000 total volume ← Main Leg
└── Leg 3 (Charlie's team): $5,000 total volume

- **Main Leg**: $15,000 (largest)
- **Other Legs**: $8,000 + $5,000 = $13,000

**Rank Check**: 
- Main: $15K, Other: $13K
- ✅ Qualifies for **Builder** ($10K/$10K)
- ❌ Not yet **Professional** (needs $20K/$20K)

### Achieving Ranks

**How Ranks Are Awarded**:
1. Leg volumes calculated weekly (Sunday night)
2. System checks all users for qualification
3. If you qualify, rank is awarded Monday morning
4. Weekly bonus starts immediately
5. Continues for 52 weeks

**When Bonuses Stop**:
- After 52 weeks of payments
- If you reach your 3x user cap
- Rank must be re-achieved to restart bonus

### Rank Strategies

**To Achieve Higher Ranks**:

1. **Build Multiple Legs**
   - Don't focus on just one leg
   - Spread referrals across 2-3 legs
   - Helps meet "other legs" requirement

2. **Support Your Team**
   - Help directs recruit their own teams
   - Teach them the system
   - Active teams = bigger volumes

3. **Lead by Example**
   - Stay actively invested
   - Show results
   - Be available for questions

4. **Track Progress**
   - Check leg volumes in dashboard
   - See how close you are to next rank
   - Identify which legs need growth
